# Collusion-Dataset
These are the datasets used in the study for Detection of Collusion in Online Assessments.

Raw files before Feature Engineering:
- Raw_Sim_1 to Raw_Sim_6 - These are the raw files of six assessments conducted under simulated settings.
- Raw_Emp - This is the raw file of the assessment conducted in empirical setting.

Transformed files after Feature Engineering:
- FE_Sim_1 to FE_Sim_6 - These are the transformed files of six assessments conducted under simulated settings.
- Sim_Dataset - This is the merged file of the above six files (FE_Sim_1 to FE_Sim_6). Here, we assign a unique Student ID to diffrentiate between all students of different assessments. 

            1 - n = 27, ID = 0 to 26

            2 - n = 29, ID = 27 to 55

            3 - n = 53, ID = 56 to 108

            4 - n = 34, ID = 109 to 142

            5 - n = 16, ID = 143 o 158

            6 - n = 32, ID = 159 to 191

            where n is the total number of students that appeared in the respective assessment.
- Emp_Dataset - This is the transformed file of the assessment conducted under Empirical setting.
